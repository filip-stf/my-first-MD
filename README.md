## 📡 Chatbot Technologies

Chatbots are transforming the way we interact with technology, enabling seamless conversations powered by AI.  
This document explores various chatbot platforms, AI assistants, and related technologies,  
including their development, applications, and impact on digital communication.  

Below, you'll find key resources, images, and references that provide insights into chatbot advancements.  

## 🤖 What is a chatbot? 🤖

Chatbot definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot):

> A chatbot (originally chatterbot) is a software application or web interface designed to have textual or spoken conversations. Modern chatbots are typically online and use generative artificial intelligence systems that are capable of maintaining a conversation with a user in natural language and simulating the way a human would behave as a conversational partner. Such chatbots often use deep learning and natural language processing, but simpler chatbots have existed for decades.

In other words, a chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. It acts as a virtual assistant that can answer questions, provide information, or perform tasks by interpreting user input and generating appropriate responses.

**🌟 Common Uses of Chatbots:**

* Customer service *(e.g., answering FAQs)*
* E-commerce *(e.g., helping users find products)*
* Education *(e.g., language practice bots)*
* Productivity tools *(e.g., scheduling assistants)*

**🔍 Types of Chatbots:**

* Rule-based chatbots – *follow pre-defined decision trees or keyword matching.*
* AI-powered chatbots – *use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to understand context and respond more naturally.*
